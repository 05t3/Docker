# Running Wordpress on Docker

Today i'm going to be showing you how easy it is to have wordpress up and running using Docker Compose in an isolated environment built with docker containers. If you are not conversant with Docker Compose, i would suggest going through Docker's official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) of the same.

However, before we get started, you need to have `Compose` installed. If you have not yet installed it, you can do so by running the following commands

`sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`

You can test is the installation was successful by checking the version of Compose installed as shown below:

```bash
root@docker:/var/www/wordpress# docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```

We are then going to create a directory called **wordpress** in `/var/www/` where will add resources necessary to build our image. In this case, we need to create a file called `docker-compose.yml` . You can also use `.yaml` extension.

_See the snippet attached below_ üëáüèæ

```bash
docker@docker:~/Desktop$ cd /var/www/
docker@docker:/var/www$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Onk 18 22:57 .
drwxr-xr-x 15 root root 4096 Onk 18 22:57 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Onk 18 22:57 html
docker@docker:/var/www$ sudo su
[sudo] password for docker:
root@docker:/var/www# mkdir wordpress
root@docker:/var/www# cd wordpress/
root@docker:/var/www/wordpress# nano docker-file.yml
root@docker:/var/www/wordpress# cat docker-file.yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: somewordpress
      MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
      MYSQL_USER: wordpress
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress

  wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - db
    image: wordpress:latest
    volumes:
      - wordpress_data:/var/www/html
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    restart: always
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
volumes:
  db_data: {}
  wordpress_data: {}
```

You can then proceed to build the project as follows:

`docker-compose up -d`

The command above basically runs in detached mode, pulls the needed Docker Images from the docker registry since we dont have them locally on our system and starts the wordpress and database containers.

```bash
root@docker:/var/www/wordpress# docker-compose up -d

If you want to confirm if the docker images were pulled successfully, simply run `docker images` command as shown below:

```bash
root@docker:/var/www/wordpress# docker images
REPOSITORY                                      TAG            IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
wordpress                                       latest         e3a452c0a154   13 days ago     616MB

```

Since we also spin up the containers in detached mode and want to confirm if they are up and running, we can check the status by running `docker ps` command:

```bash
root@docker:/var/www/wordpress# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
fbeb6f8b9e6f   wordpress:latest             "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes    0.0.0.0:8000->80/tcp, :::8000->80/tcp       wordpress_wordpress_1

```

In order to access our wordpress site, we can access it on port 8000 since we binded it to port 80 on the 0.0.0.0.
If we fire up our browser, we can reach it on `http://machine_ip:8000` as shown in the screenshots below.

Provide Site Title, Username, password and an email and start the installation process which is very fast.

After the installation completes, simply login using the credentials configuredin the previous step and you should have access to the dashboard. Easy, right?üòÉüíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you want to shutdown the wordpress site, simply run `docker-compose down` which removes the containers created , default network created but preserve the WordPress database. You can also confirm the containers are not running by running `docker ps` command.

```bash
root@docker:/var/www/wordpress# docker-compose down
Stopping wordpress_wordpress_1 ... done
Stopping wordpress_db_1        ... done
Removing wordpress_wordpress_1 ... done
Removing wordpress_db_1        ... done
